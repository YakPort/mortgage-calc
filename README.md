# MortgageROI

This project is for [MortgageROI.com](https://www.mortgageroi.com), a calculator to help potential home buyers understand whether it makes sense to buy a house.

Many mortgage calculators are overly simplistic, returning to the user a simple 'buy or rent' determination.

This calculator seeks to show the user a *return* and the *drivers of that return.*

Would love any feedback, pull requests, etc.

## Getting Started

Getting set up locally is simple.  Once you've cloned the project: 

1) Run `pip install requirements.txt`
2) Set up a local_settings.py file and put drop it in the mortgage/ folder where the settings.py file lives
